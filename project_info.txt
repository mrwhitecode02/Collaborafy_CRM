Workflow:

Planning and Design:

1- Define your target audience and their needs. What types of businesses will use Collaborafy? What are their 
key pain points in managing relationships and data?

R/ = answers...

2- Identify core features. Start with essential features like contact management, lead pipeline, deal stages, 
task management, reporting, and security.

3- Plan user interface and user experience (UI/UX). Sketch wireframes or mockups to visualize the interface 
and user flow.

4- Choose front-end technology. Decide if you want a web-based or mobile app, and select a framework like 
React.js, Vue.js, or Angular.

Backend Development with Node.js:

1- Set up the Node.js environment. Choose a framework like Express.js for faster development.

2- Design your database schema. Decide on a database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL based on your needs 
and scalability.

3- Implement API endpoints. These will handle data requests and responses from the front-end, like creating, 
reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data for contacts, deals, tasks, etc.

4- Integrate authentication and authorization. Define user roles and permissions to control access 
to data and features.

5- Implement reporting and analytics. Allow users to generate reports and gain insights from their data.

Front-end Development:

- Develop the user interface components based on your UI/UX design.

- Connect the front-end to the backend API using tools like Axios or Fetch API.

- Design interactive elements for a user-friendly experience.

Testing and Deployment:

- Thoroughly test all functionalities and features.

- Consider beta testing with a small group of users to gather feedback.

- Deploy your application to a web server like Heroku or AWS.

Key Technologies:

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL)

Front-end: React.js, Vue.js, Angular (or similar framework)

Authentication: Firebase Authentication, JWT-based solution

Testing: Jest, Mocha, Chai

Deployment: Heroku, AWS, Azure

MVP Definition:

1. Contact Management:

- Create and manage contacts: Allow users to add, edit, and delete contact information, including name,
email, phone number, company, and other relevant details.

- Search and filter contacts: Enable users to easily find specific contacts using search bars and filtering 
options based on various criteria.

- Contact details view: Display comprehensive information about each contact, including notes, interaction history, 
and associated deals and tasks.

2. Lead Pipeline:

- Create and manage lead stages: Define different stages in your sales process (e.g., Prospect, 
Qualified Lead, Proposal Sent, Closed Won/Lost).

- Move leads through the pipeline: Allow users to easily move leads between stages as they progress through the 
sales funnel.

- Visualize the pipeline: Provide a visual representation of the current state of leads in each stage, 
using charts or kanban boards.

3. Deal Management:

- Create and manage deals: Allow users to create new deals, associate them with contacts and leads, and 
track deal details like value, closing date, and stage.

- Track deal progress: Enable users to update deals with notes, communication history, and progress towards closing.

- Visualize deal pipeline: Offer a similar visual representation of deals in different stages as with the 
lead pipeline.

4. Task Management:

- Create and assign tasks: Allow users to create tasks related to specific contacts, leads, or deals, and 
assign them to other users.

- Set due dates and priorities: Enable users to set deadlines and priorities for tasks to effectively 
manage their workload.

- Track task completion: Provide a way to track the completion status of tasks and collaborate with team members.

5. Basic Reporting:

Generate basic reports: 

Offer simple reports on key metrics like the number of leads generated, deals closed, and overall 
sales pipeline performance.

Visualize reports: 

Present reports in a user-friendly format, such as charts and graphs, for easy data comprehension.

Export reports: 

Allow users to export reports in common formats like CSV or PDF for further analysis.

Additional Considerations:

- User authentication and authorization: Implement a secure login system and manage user roles and permissions to control 
access to data and features.

Basic UI/UX design: Create a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate.

- Data security: Prioritize data security by implementing best practices such as encryption and secure storage 
for sensitive information.
